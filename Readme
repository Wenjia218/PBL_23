The topic of the project is Gene regulation and the gene expression data of DNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under different condition (temperatures, gene knock down, gene knock out) were used.
It is focused on how specific heat shock factors can affect the gene regulation in yeast.

All work done together by Wenjia Zhong and Anna Lisa Heit.
